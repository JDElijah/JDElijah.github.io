## About Me
I am completing an Associate’s Degree in Computer Science and have a background in film and media studies. My interests sit at the intersection of game design, programming, and interactive systems, with an emphasis on clear mechanics, thoughtful design, and practical implementation.

## Repository Purpose
This repository is intended as:
- A public-facing portfolio
- A lightweight, maintainable static site
- A living project that evolves as I build and refine new work
